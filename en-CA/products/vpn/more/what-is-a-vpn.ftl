vpn-what-is-many-of-us = Many of us spend multiple hours a day using the internet to do everyday things like watching videos, shopping, gaming and paying bills, all the way to managing complex work projects and having confidential video calls. A <strong>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</strong> is one of the best ways to stay private and secure online, and keep your personal data protected.
vpn-what-is-how-do-vpns = How do VPNs work?
vpn-what-is-a-vpn-is = A VPN is a tool that allows you to access the internet securely wherever you are. A VPN works by creating a secure “tunnel” between your device and your VPN provider, and it protects you in two key ways:
vpn-what-is-concealing-your-ip = Concealing your IP address, protecting your identity and location.
vpn-what-is-encrypting-your-traffic = Encrypting your traffic between you and your VPN provider so that no one on your local network can decipher or modify it.
vpn-what-is-in-the-past = In the past, VPNs were mainly used by corporations to allow secure remote access to their internal services and proprietary data. Now, however, VPNs are available to anyone who wants to protect their connection to the internet, especially when it’s over porous networks like public WiFi, but it’s even useful on a home network.
