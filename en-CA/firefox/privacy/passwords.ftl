# page content
privacy-passwords-a-security-guide = A security guide to safer logins and passwords
privacy-passwords-protecting-your-accounts = Protecting your accounts doesn’t have to be complicated — and { -brand-name-firefox } can help.
privacy-passwords-more-and-more = More and more of the sensitive, valuable things in our life are guarded through password-protected online accounts — love letters, medical records, bank accounts and more. Websites use login procedures to protect those valuable things. Generally, as long as someone can’t log into your account, they can’t read your email or transfer money out of your bank account. As we live our lives online, how should we protect our logins?
# tl;dr is an abbreviation for "Too long; didn't read". This is a playful way to say "summary" or "overview"
privacy-passwords-tldr = tl;dr:
privacy-passwords-use-random-passwords = Use random passwords, and use a different password for every site
privacy-passwords-pay-attention-to = Pay attention to the browser’s security signals, and be suspicious
privacy-passwords-make-your-answers = Make your answers to security questions just as strong as your passwords
privacy-passwords-use-a-password = Use a password manager to make creating and remembering passwords easier
privacy-passwords-use-twofactor-authentication = Use “two-factor authentication” wherever you can
privacy-passwords-its-hard-out = It’s hard out there for a password
privacy-passwords-most-logins-today = Most logins today are protected by a password. If an attacker can get your password, they can access your account and do anything you could do with that account. So when you ask how secure your account is, you should really be thinking about how safe your password is. And that means you have to think about all the different ways that an attacker could access your account’s password:
privacy-passwords-seeing-you-use = Seeing you use it with an unencrypted website
privacy-passwords-guessing-it = Guessing it
privacy-passwords-stealing-a-file = Stealing a file that has your password in it
privacy-passwords-using-password-recovery = Using password  recovery to reset it
privacy-passwords-tricking-you-into = Tricking you into giving it to them
privacy-passwords-to-keep-your = To keep your login safe, you need to prevent as many of these as possible. Each risk has a different corresponding mitigation.
privacy-passwords-look-for-the = Look for the lock in your browser
privacy-passwords-its-easy-to = It’s easy to prevent attackers from stealing your password when you log into an unencrypted website: Think twice before you type your password if you don’t see a lock icon in the URL bar, like this:
privacy-passwords-a-closed-lock = A closed padlock appears just before the website address in the URL bar in all major browsers.
privacy-passwords-the-lock-means = The lock means that the website you’re using is encrypted, so that even if someone is watching your browsing on the network (like another person on a public WiFi hotspot), they won’t be able to see your password. { -brand-name-firefox } will try to warn you when you’re about to enter your password on an unencrypted site.
privacy-passwords-a-padlock-with = A padlock with a line through it indicates the connection is not secure.
privacy-passwords-your-browser-also = Your browser also helps keep you informed about how trustworthy sites are, to help keep you safe from phishing. When you try to visit a website that is known to be a phishing site, { -brand-name-firefox } (and any major browser) will display a full-screen warning — <strong>pay attention and think twice about using that site!</strong>
privacy-passwords-firefox-will = Firefox will display a warning instead of the website if it is known to be a phishing site.
privacy-passwords-in-general-the = In general, the best defense against phishing is to <strong>be suspicious of what you receive</strong>, whether it shows up in email, a text message or on the phone. Instead of taking action on what someone sent you, visit the site directly. For example, if an email says you need to reset your PayPal password, don’t click the link. Type in paypal.com yourself. If the bank calls, call them back.
privacy-passwords-strength-in-diversity = Strength in diversity
