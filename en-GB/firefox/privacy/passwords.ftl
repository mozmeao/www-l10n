# page content
privacy-passwords-a-security-guide = A security guide to safer logins and passwords
privacy-passwords-protecting-your-accounts = Protecting your accounts doesn’t have to be complicated — and { -brand-name-firefox } can help.
privacy-passwords-more-and-more = More and more of the sensitive, valuable things in our life are guarded through password-protected online accounts — love letters, medical records, bank accounts and more. Web sites use login procedures to protect those valuable things. Generally, as long as someone can’t log into your account, they can’t read your email or transfer money out of your bank account. As we live our lives online, how should we protect our logins?
# tl;dr is an abbreviation for "Too long; didn't read". This is a playful way to say "summary" or "overview"
privacy-passwords-tldr = tl;dr:
privacy-passwords-use-random-passwords = Use random passwords, and use a different password for every site
privacy-passwords-pay-attention-to = Pay attention to the browser’s security signals, and be suspicious
privacy-passwords-make-your-answers = Make your answers to security questions just as strong as your passwords
privacy-passwords-use-a-password = Use a password manager to make creating and remembering passwords easier
privacy-passwords-use-twofactor-authentication = Use “two-factor authentication” wherever you can
privacy-passwords-its-hard-out = It’s hard out there for a password
privacy-passwords-most-logins-today = Most logins today are protected by a password. If an attacker can get your password, he can access your account and do anything you could do with that account. So when you ask how secure your account is, you should really be thinking about how safe your password is. And that means you have to think about all the different ways that an attacker could access your account’s password:
privacy-passwords-seeing-you-use = Seeing you use it with an unencrypted web site
privacy-passwords-guessing-it = Guessing it
privacy-passwords-stealing-a-file = Stealing a file that has your password in it
privacy-passwords-using-password-recovery = Using password recovery to reset it
privacy-passwords-tricking-you-into = Tricking you into giving it to them
privacy-passwords-to-keep-your = To keep your login safe, you need to prevent as many of these as possible. Each risk has a different corresponding mitigation.
privacy-passwords-look-for-the = Look for the lock in your browser
privacy-passwords-its-easy-to = It’s easy to prevent attackers from stealing your password when you log into an unencrypted web site: Think twice before you type your password if you don’t see a lock icon in the URL bar, like this:
privacy-passwords-a-closed-lock = A closed padlock appears just before the web site address in the URL bar in all major browsers.
privacy-passwords-the-lock-means = The lock means that the web site you’re using is encrypted, so that even if someone is watching your browsing on the network (like another person on a public WiFi hotspot), they won’t be able to see your password. { -brand-name-firefox } will try to warn you when you’re about to enter your password on an unencrypted site.
privacy-passwords-a-padlock-with = A padlock with a line through it indicates the connection is not secure.
privacy-passwords-your-browser-also = Your browser also helps keep you informed about how trustworthy sites are, to help keep you safe from phishing. On the one hand, when you try to visit a website that is known to be a phishing site, { -brand-name-firefox } (and any major browser) will display a full-screen warning — <strong>pay attention and think twice about using that site!</strong>
privacy-passwords-firefox-will = Firefox will display a warning instead of the web site if it is known to be a phishing site.
privacy-passwords-in-general-the = In general, the best defense against phishing is to <strong>be suspicious of what you receive</strong>, whether it shows up in email, a text message or on the phone. Instead of taking action on what someone sent you, visit the site directly. For example, if an email says you need to reset your PayPal password, don’t click the link. Type in paypal.com yourself. If the bank calls, call them back.
privacy-passwords-strength-in-diversity = Strength in diversity
privacy-passwords-the-secret-to = The secret to preventing guessing, theft or password reset is a whole lot of randomness. When attackers try to guess passwords, they usually do two things: 1) Use “dictionaries” — lists of common passwords that people use all the time, and 2) make some random guesses. The <strong>longer and more random your password is</strong>, the less likely that either of these guessing techniques will find it.

#   $url_yahoo (string) - link to https://www.wired.com/2016/12/yahoo-hack-billion-users/ with additional attributes for analytics
privacy-passwords-when-an-attacker = When an attacker steals the password database for a site that you use (like <a { $url_linkedin }>LinkedIn</a> or <a { $url_yahoo }>Yahoo</a>), there’s nothing you can do but change your password for that site. That’s bad, but the damage can be much worse if you’ve re-used that password with other websites — then the attacker can access your accounts on those sites as well. To keep the damage contained, <strong>always use different passwords for different web sites.</strong>
#   $url_monitor (string) - link to https://monitor.firefox.com/ with additional attributes for analytics
privacy-passwords-use-firefox-monitor = Use <a { $url_monitor }>{ -brand-name-firefox-monitor }</a> to keep an eye on email addresses associated with your accounts. If your email address appears in a known corporate data breach, you’ll be alerted and provided steps to follow to protect the affected account.
privacy-passwords-security-questions-my = Security Questions: My mother’s maiden name is “Ff926AKa9j6Q”
privacy-passwords-finally-most-websites = Finally, most web sites let you recover your password if you’ve forgotten it. Usually these systems make you answer some “security questions” before you can reset your password. <strong>The answers to these questions need to be just as secret as your password.</strong> Otherwise, an attacker can guess the answers and set your password to something they know.
